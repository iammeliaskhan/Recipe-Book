# Recipe Book

Recipe Book is a front-end web application that allows users to search for recipes based on keywords, filter recipes by diet and cuisine preferences, view recipe details including ingredients and nutritional information, and save recipes to a personal recipe book.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and makes use of the Spoonacular API for recipe search functionality. The application follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, where the Model represents the data and business logic, the View represents the user interface, and the Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View.

## Features

Recipe Book offers several features to its users, including:

- **Recipe search:** Users can search for recipes by entering keywords into a search bar, which will return a list of relevant recipes.
- **Filtering:** Users can filter their search results by selecting dietary and cuisine preferences such as vegetarian, gluten-free, or Italian.
- **Recipe details:** Clicking on a recipe in the search results will bring up a modal window displaying detailed information about the recipe, including a list of ingredients, preparation time, cooking instructions, and nutritional information.
- **Personal recipe book:** Users can save recipes to their personal recipe book by clicking the "Save" button on the recipe details modal. Saved recipes are stored locally in the browser's LocalStorage and can be accessed at any time by clicking the "My Recipes" button in the navigation bar.
- **User interface:** The application features a clean, user-friendly interface that is responsive to different screen sizes and devices.
